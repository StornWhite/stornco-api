# stornco-api
Backend repository for my personal website and showcase for full stack
engineering with Python and Django.

The backend stack includes:

 + Django Rest Framework 3.5.3
 + Django 1.10.5
 + Python 3.4
 + PostgreSQL 9.6

Deployed to AWS with Elastic Beanstalk.

The purpose of this site is to provide a comprehensive view of the architecture
and best practices of a modern, python and django backed webapp deployed to
AWS.  For that reason, the app functionality is quite modest.  My goal is to
provide a template for setting up and deploying all of the systems in a
professional web app.  I don't want to obscure that goal by making the app
itself too complicated.
